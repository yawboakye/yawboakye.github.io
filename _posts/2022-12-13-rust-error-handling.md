Programming, no, software engineering, no engineering, in fact, is fraught with
errors. Hell, the more correct thing to say is that all human endeavors are
fraught with errors, and software engineering is no exception. Except, here, the
prevalence of errors are prescribed by all sorts of laws of nature: biological,
psychological, chemical, physical. Essentially errors are ubiquitous, that it
makes one wonder whether the functioning state of any software application
should be considered as the exception instead.
